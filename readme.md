# IAGT React Components Library

This is a library of React components that can be used in any React project. You can import it as remote package or just copy and paste the components you need.

All components are isolated and can be used independently.

In order to use as remote in a monorepo or microfrontend project, hot reload is not enabled yet. You can run this repo isolated to develop new components.
